Each document has the following fields:
    id      (str): Unique identifier for the passage.
    text    (str): The knowledge passage itself.
    source  (str): The original document/publication the passage is drawn from.

Broilers sell through: open markets, restaurants, supermarkets, direct household sales. Village chickens command premium prices (ZMW 120-250 per bird) and have strong demand during festive seasons. Layers generate daily cash flow through regular egg sales. Common success factors: quality products, reliable supply, customer relationships, responsive to feedback, use of social media for promotion, partnership with established retail channels. Scale-appropriate strategies work best - household traders for village chickens, bulk arrangements with restaurants and supermarkets for broilers, daily collection systems for layer eggs.",

Village chicken farming: home-mixed feeds, free-range foraging reduces feeding costs, natural brooding with mother hens vs artificial heat. Layer farming: efficient feed formulations, long production cycles reduce per-bird fixed costs. Universal cost-saving approaches: preventive health management (vaccination/biosecurity) far cheaper than treating disease, equipment sharing between cycles, cooperative purchasing to leverage bulk discounts, waste management/recycling of nutrients to reduce input costs.",
